- ⚡ Fun fact: I pioneered the first barefoot trek around the entire coastline of florida, covering over 1,200 miles of coastline and canoeing over 110 miles though the everglades. 
I collected oceanic plastic discharge from the beaches and brought 3k lbs of this plastic to the Historic Florida state capital steps for plastic pollution awareness
